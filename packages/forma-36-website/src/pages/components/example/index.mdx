## Best practices <a name="best-practices" />

- Use the Entry Card for embedding references to entries only.
- Don't use the Entry Card to represent a list of entries or assets please refer to the EntityList component for this purpose.

## Variations <a name="variations" />

Describe important properties on the component and give examples. Important properties configure a component to serve its main purposes

**_E.g: Button Component_**

The Button component can be configured in a number of different ways. Here is a guide to when to use certain variations.

### Button types (`buttonType`) <a name="button-types" />

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Button buttonType="primary">Primary</Button>
  <Button buttonType="negative">Negative</Button>
  <Button buttonType="positive">Positive</Button>
  <Button buttonType="muted">Muted</Button>
  <Button buttonType="naked">Naked</Button>
</React.Fragment>
```

### With icon (`icon`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Button buttonType="primary" icon="Settings">
    Primary
  </Button>
  <Button buttonType="negative" icon="Settings">
    Negative
  </Button>
  <Button buttonType="positive" icon="Settings">
    Positive
  </Button>
  <Button buttonType="muted" icon="Settings">
    Muted
  </Button>
  <Button buttonType="naked" icon="Settings">
    Naked
  </Button>
</React.Fragment>
```

### Sizes (`size`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Button buttonType="muted" size="large">
    Large
  </Button>
  <Button buttonType="muted">Default</Button>
  <Button buttonType="muted" size="small">
    Small
  </Button>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Copy considerations <a name="copy-considerations" />

(optional) If the component has specific copy considerations mention them in this section

- Do not use punctuation following a label
- Use sentence-style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized) on labels
