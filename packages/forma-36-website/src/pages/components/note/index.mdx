## Best practices

- Consider the context of where the note is displayed when selecting the type of note to use
- Don't confuse notes with notifications, which appear as feedback after a user has performed an action

## Variations

The Note component can be configured in a number of different ways. Learn when to use certain variations with this guide.

### Note types (`noteType`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note>Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note noteType="positive">Positive</Note>
  <Note noteType="warning">Warning</Note>
  <Note noteType="negative">Negative</Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

| Note Type    | Notes                                                                                                                   |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary**  | Used to display messages which are purely informational - they have neither positive, negative, or warning connotations |
| **Positive** | Used to display positive messages                                                                                       |
| **Negative** | For negative/highly critical messages - for informing of errors                                                         |
| **Warning**  | Used for a warning messages                                                                                             |

### Note with title (`title`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Note title="Primary title">Primary (default)</Note>
  <Note title="Positive title" noteType="positive">
    Positive
  </Note>
  <Note title="Warning title" noteType="warning">
    Warning
  </Note>
  <Note title="Negative title" noteType="negative">
    Negative
  </Note>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Copy considerations

- Use clear and succinct copy
- Ensure note is scannable. Focus on the objective and limit the number of concepts in each sentence
- Use progressive disclosure. Eliminate extra details that can be revealed as the user interacts and requires more information.
- Use active voice, present tense, and consider tone of voice depending on the circumstance
- To add additional context, link out to documentation
- Do not preface the instructions with introductory text, such as "please"
