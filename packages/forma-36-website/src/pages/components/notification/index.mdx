## Best practices <a name="best-practices" />

Add best practices for usage in the UI, think about copy and accessibility or general UX guidelines
E.g (Button Component):

- Position buttons consistently in the interface
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion.

## Variations <a name="variations" />

### With icon (`icon`) <a name="customized" />

```jsx
<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
```

### Sizes (`size`)

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Button buttonType="muted" size="large">
    Large
  </Button>
  <Button buttonType="muted">Default</Button>
  <Button buttonType="muted" size="small">
    Small
  </Button>
</React.Fragment>
```

## Copy considerations <a name="copy-considerations" />

(optional) If the component has specific copy considerations mention them in this section

- Do not use punctuation following a label
- Use sentence-style caps (in which only the first word of a sentence or term is capitalized) on labels

## Accessibility <a name="accessibility" />

(optional) If the component has specific a11y requirements mention them here
